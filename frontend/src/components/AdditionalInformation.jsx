			<h3>Community Agreement</h3>

			<p>
				Our Mission: Cornucopia Inc. is an arts and wellness center run by and for people in mental health and substance
				use recovery. We promote growth and dignity through self-directed recovery and peer support.
				At Cornucopia we celebrate and value diversity, even while we explore the commonalities that we share. We know
				there is strength in our diversity, and together we all achieve more than we can alone. Cornucopia does not
				discriminate against any protected class, and will provide reasonable accommodations to the known disabilities
				of any member, if needed, to participate in a program.
				As a community, we agree to three principles:
				<ul>
					<li>Take care of yourself</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Know when you need assistance, and ask for it as clearly as you can Don’t be afraid to speak up for yourself
								To be at Cornucopia, you must be independent in your basic needs: Cornucopia does not provide personal
								attendants.
							</li>
						</ul> 
					<li>Take care of each other</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Give assistance, if asked, or direct requests to a host, volunteer, or other resources, if you can’t
								help Speak up for others if you see something wrong Respect other people’s right to privacy and
								confidentiality, including not doing anything to or with another person without their consent.
								Any behavior that is disruptive or verbally, physically, or emotionally threatening or abusive to
								anyone will not be tolerated, and may result in being asked to leave.
							</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Take care of the space we share</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Don’t waste our supplies, use only what you need Take responsibility to clean up Help us maintain our space in good
								condition.
							</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

				My signature shows I will do my part to maintain the Cornucopia community as a safe, clean, pleasant and supportive environment for all.
				I understand that a failure to abide by any of the principles in this agreement may be grounds for being asked to leave the
				Cornucopia community.
